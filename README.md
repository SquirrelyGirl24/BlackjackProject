### Blackjack Project

### Overview
In this project I created a command-line, single deck Blackjack card game. It utilizes the Deck, Card and Hand classes to represent the Dealer, Player & BlackjackHand classes in the BlackjackApp class.

* Each player is dealt 2 cards. 
* The dealers 1st card is face down, the second one is face up. * Cards values are added up for their totals.
* Players "hit" to gain another card from the deck or "stay" to keep their current total.
* Dealer "hits" until they equal or exceed 17.
* The goal is to have a higher card total than the dealer without going over 21.
* If the totals between the player and dealer are equal, it is a "push" and the hand ends.
* If either the dealer or player are dealt a 21 on the first deal, that's Blackjack.

### Technologies used
* Java
* Enums
* OO Design
* Google
* Github

### Lessons Learned
Figuring out how all the classes talk to each other and learning how to separate packages/classes accordingly to the projects.

I need to get better at calling methods and classes to make code shorter and easier.
